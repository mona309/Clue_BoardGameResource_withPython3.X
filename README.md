# Clue Board Game Resource
Made as a project for semester 1 end-semester project.

An application that provides a board with card deck and dices for enjoyment of the game "Clue" while playing without a physical game. While the application removes the need for the actual board and item it requires one player to act as the Game Master (GM) to check player movements and card status. 

Made with python3 using tkinter, PIL, os and time modules

 > Cluedo (Clue) is a murder mystery game for three to six players.

> The object of the game is to determine who murdered the game's victim, where the crime took place, and which weapon was used.
> Each player assumes the role of one of the six suspects and attempts to deduce the correct answer by strategically moving around a game board representing the rooms of a mansion and collecting clues about the circumstances of the murder from the other players.
